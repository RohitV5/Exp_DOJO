1.SSH

SSH is a protocol like FTP,IMAP, POP3, HTTP, HTTPS (transmission is secured that is encrypted, so eavsdropping will not work)

SSH allows us to communicate between two computers over internet. WE can modify files on remote computer. It is also secured.

Shell allows us to talk to the operating system. So we can access the OS and file system on the other system.

HOST is the remote server.
CLIENT is the system you are using to access the remote system.

-->command to connect<--
ssh {user}@{host}
